# JDBC_Plus
This is a lightweight JDBC tool class where you only need two files to connect to your database and manage it
note:
1.Only one key-value pair can be stored in a map
2.The pseudo-classes in the function are all your custom classes
3.I'm a rookie, if you think it's easy to use, you can give me a star, if there's a problem with this, please communicate with me, thanks
